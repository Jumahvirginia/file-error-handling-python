# file-error-handling-python

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates **file reading, writing, and error handling**.  
It asks the user for a filename, reads its content, modifies the content, and saves it into a new file.  
If the file does not exist or cannot be read, the program handles errors gracefully.

---

## Features
- Reads text from an existing file.
- Modifies the content (example: converts it to uppercase).
- Saves the modified content into a new file with the prefix `modified_`.
- Handles file errors such as missing files or read issues.
